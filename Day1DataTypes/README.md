```java
   Ntg is required to slove this 
   so, don't worry about it 
   just gohead.....

# Day one HackerRank dataTypes Question. don't think very simple lolipop question in front crocodial festival is there

Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):

A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
A long is a 64-bit signed integer.
Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor.

Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case, , is comprised of a single line with an integer, , which can be arbitrarily large or small.

Output Format

For each input variable  and appropriate primitive , you must determine if the given primitives are capable of storing it. If yes, then print:

n can be fitted in:
* dataType
If there is more than one appropriate data type, print each one on its own line and order them by size (i.e.: ).

If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitives, print the line:

n can't be fitted anywhere.
Sample Input

5
-150
150000
1500000000
213333333333333333333333333333333333
-100000000000000
Sample Output

-150 can be fitted in:
* short
* int
* long
150000 can be fitted in:
* int
* long
1500000000 can be fitted in:
* int
* long
213333333333333333333333333333333333 can't be fitted anywhere.
-100000000000000 can be fitted in:
* long
Explanation

 can be stored in a short, an int, or a long.

 is very large and is outside of the allowable range of values for the primitive data types discussed in this problem.as leading zeroes.
