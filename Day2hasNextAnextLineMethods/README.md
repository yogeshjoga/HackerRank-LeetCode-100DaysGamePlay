## 2nd day question is 
```java

The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

Output Format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

Sample Input

Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.
Sample Output

1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.
```
